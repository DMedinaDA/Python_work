This Python script provides a simple command-line tool for converting between different units of length measurement: inches, feet, and yards.

##Improvements:
Fixed the yards to feet conversion by correcting the condition check from 'convert_from' to 'convert_to'
Changed input type for yards from int() to float() to allow for more precise measurements
Added rounding to two decimal places for yard conversions (round(..., 2))
Removed one layer of print() function in the yards conversion output statements

##Similarities:
Both versions maintain the same overall structure and logic
Input collection method remains consistent
Conversion formulas are correct in both versions
Error handling for incorrect inputs is present in both
 
##Key takeaways:
The second version shows attention to detail in fixing specific issues
Demonstrates ability to identify and correct logical errors in code
Shows understanding of data types (int vs float) and their impact on calculations

## This Python script implements a Unit Conversion Tool designed to convert between inches, feet, and yards. It offers a user-friendly command-line interface that prompts users for input and output units, as well as the measurement value. 
## The tool handles various input formats and is case-insensitive, enhancing its usability. It employs nested conditional statements to determine the appropriate conversion formula based on user input. 
## The script successfully performs six different types of conversions: inches to feet/yards, feet to inches/yards, and yards to inches/feet. 
## Results are rounded for readability, though there's some inconsistency in the rounding precision across different conversions. 
## While functional, the code could benefit from optimization, particularly in areas of input validation, error handling, and code structure.
## Despite these potential improvements, the script serves as a solid foundation for a unit conversion tool, demonstrating practical application of Python programming concepts such as user input handling, string manipulation, and basic arithmetic operations.
